    "How it works:\n",
    "- for each month, we ranked companies according to their mean engagement rates\n",
    "- in the end, we averaged the company rankings and took the top and bottom three as outliers\n",
    "\n",
    "Reasons:\n",
    "- need something to start with\n",
    "- measure consistency and social media engagement (relative to followers), which is one of the most relevant metrics used in social media marketing.\n",
    "- gives insight into best-performing and worst-performing companies, which can serve as indicators for investment opportunities and risk management, which we will explore more **in a later section**\n",
    "\n",
    "Results:\n",
    "Looking at the top ranked company each montch yields 28 companies which occupied this spot. This indicates that the space for online engagement is heavily contested and user engagement is not very steady. Nonetheless, engagement is distributed very unequally - there is a small subset of companies, which \"figured out\" social media, who compete for the top spots of user engagement. To analize what makes a company over- or underperform on social media metrics, we further examine the top and bottom 3 companies of all time. These are calculated by averaging the ranks of all companies over all the respective months, where they have been present on social media. This yields the following table, where the rank rated by engagement rate is their average rank out of 704 companies. Here we display the top 10 companies\n",

    "What's immediately noteworthy is that companies with the lowest engagement have nonetheless been on the platform for some time, while there are very new companies that can be among the top. This highlights the fast-pace nature of the social media environment for companies.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Finding Unicorn\" seems to be taking the best advantage of this. It's a Toy manufacturer producing cute figurine art toys. They self-categorize as a trend-art company. Their products are very visual in nature, making for very engaging social media posts. Additionally, the company is rather small and seems to put a lot of effort into it's friendly image, which may encourage users to engage more with their content rather than just consuming it.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Pop Mart\" is a very similar business. However, in contrast to \"Finding Unicorn\" they seem to put less value in appearing like a small local company harboring creativity and artistic expression. This indicates that such an image, while useful, is not necessary to succeed on social media. Such user behavior is perhaps also explained by the demographic - young people might interact on social media more readily - however, our dataset includes no information which would allow us to study this further.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Funko\" is another business in the same branch. However, it has been around for a lot longer and is the main producer of such figurines.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus we can see that having a visually appealing product is a big predictor of social media success, independent of several other variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another branch that is well represented in the top social media performers are fashion brands. Additionally to the previously exmained factor of visuality, we can extract additional important traits by examining the social media presence of these companies. Many of these companies make occasional posts which seem unrelated to their product, which seems to differentiate them from other companies with less engagement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Among the low performers, the company \"Powerade\" stuck out to us, since it is relatively well known and belongs to the coca-cola company. \n",

    "Even though coca-cola is an extremely popular brand, only the account of Costa Coffe is somewhat successful on instagram. This is most likely due to their more familiar approach to social media. Their other accounts are mostly focused on design rather than relatability, which seems to hinder engagement. Nonetheless, the Coca-Cola share price does not reflect a slowed growth in the age of social media. Thus there is room for a company to thrive without overperforming on social media, however this is most likely due to Coca-Colas previous popularity.\n",
