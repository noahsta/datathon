Through some basic plots filtering by the different industries, we detected a lot of variability both within and between the different types of companies. What's more, the data columns provided to us (\"followers\", \"picture\" etc.) doesn't exhibit any immediate room for conclusions. Therefore we decided to engineer a series of features, that can make analysis more graspable."

Analysing these by the baseline engagement rate model yields a variety of results, indicating that we extracted a more complex set of outliers by this method. To interpret these, we employ a surrogate model, which will express the decision boundaries between outliers and regular points."
