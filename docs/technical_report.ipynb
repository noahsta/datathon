    "    - compare to industry?\n",
    "    - long & strong brand history\n",
    "    - strong brand ambassadors\n",
    "    - good ethics of company (planting trees etc)\n",
    "    - funny social media accounts whatever\n",
    "\n",
    "2. identify outlier firms on lower end\n",
    "\n",
    "    -> signals issues with brand perception, customer engagement, or emerging crises\n",
    "    -> poses risk to company's long-term stability \n",
    "    -> requires proactive (risk) management.\n",

    "\n",
    "    - this is actually more of the data exploration part, but we need to synthesize the findings into the insights report because other groups might not do it, so it gives us an edge\n",
    "  \n",
    "    -> can indicate broader market trends / shifts in consumer behaviour\n",
    "    -> can help more informed broadcasting & market analysis\n",
    "    -> more of a tool to use as input to more complex market models\n",
    "    -> can probably work well together with recent LLMs that consume market news/sentiment because social media is a good representation of what people think\n",
    "\n",
    "4. identify actual weird outlier firms -> can generate solid investment advice, probably\n",
    "\n",
    "    -> idea with k-means clustering: have them clustered according to performance features\n",
    "    -> then find \"bad stock performance\" companies in \"good social media performance\" companies and vice versa\n",
    "\n",
    "5. general UBS use of our analysis: advise their customers why their competitors are outliers, which can help the clients refine their competitive strategies. Identifying key factors leading to higher engagement can inform better marketing strategies. & also: Product and Service Development: Insights derived from social media performance can influence decisions about product innovations or adjustments, focusing on areas that resonate with or displease the market."
